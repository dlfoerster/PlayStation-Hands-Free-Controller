# PlayStation-Hands-Free-Controller

### SETUP:

1. Ensure your laptop has a working camera
2. Download PS Remote Play (this can be found [here](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/remote-play/)
3. Sign into PS Remote Play and connect your playstation to it
4. Now run ps4.py from the terminal or another IDE
5. Position the PS Remote Play tab so you can see both the ps4.py GUI as well as the Remote Play tab
6. Click back to PS Remote Play so that it is in the foreground
7. Move your hand around to go left, right, up or down!

### IMPORTANT NOTE ON TRIGGERING THE BUTTONS:

The left button triggers when all fingers but the thumb (if using left hand) or pinky (if using right hand) are close to the left edge of the screen.
The right button triggers when all fingers but the pinky (if using left hand) or thumb (if using right hand) are close to the right udge of the screen.
The up and down buttons trigger when all fingers are near the top or bottom edge of the screen.

To select the cross or circle buttons, put your hand into a fist, with the palm facing toward the screen, and raise only your index and middle finger. Then, the button will trigger when the top 2 yellow dots on both fingers are within the buttons square. For this it may help to move your hand further from the camera so the yellow dots can all fit.
